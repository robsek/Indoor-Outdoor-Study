In experiment, implemented in PsychoPy, subjects categortized a briefly presented scene as indoor or outdoor. 
Half the scenes in each category had been blurred with a Gaussian low-pass filter to remove some spectral content 
that might be important to the categorization.  
This R code analyses the results of one subject.  will be expanded later to do batch processing all subjects.

Will add PsychoPy code later.
